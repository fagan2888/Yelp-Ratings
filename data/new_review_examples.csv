Timestamp,Please write a review below for any business:,Please rate the business on a scale of 1 to 5,"Though I got what I was looking for, this store is very disappointing.  The problem  I had was that many aisles were not labeled properly which made it difficult for me to quickly find the things I needed.  I only came in for four items and it should not have taken 40 minutes to find them and check out.  There were also not readily available team members to ask about where these products were located.  Very disappointing.","Ankur explained my dishwasher problem and helped me weigh some options in a 50/50 repair or replace situation. Other notable factors, he was polite, on time, knowledgeable, clear and honest. I have no complaints.We will use this company again, but we hope we don't need to.",This is literally the worst Tropical Smoothie I've ever been to. Smoothies are watery EVERY time. Staff barely comes to the counter or they just chat with each other while you're waiting. If you order online the smoothies aren't kept refrigerated so they're melted before you even get there. Once I gave the cashier a gift card and then a dollar to cover the difference and the cashier puts in my dollar and hands me back my gift card with .48. Makes no sense at all. Horrible customer service at this place!,This is a new Paisanos location and I decided to give it a try. I've been to Paisanos in Centreville and thought it was good but out of the way for me. I ordered the chicken parm sub platter which included fries. You could tell the employees were still learning and trying to figure out how to serve customers and use the cash registers. The sub was good but the fries were not good at all. The fries were fresh and hot but they were soggy and did not have a good flavor. The sub had lots of cheese and the marinara sauce had a good flavor.  One of the employees was friendly the other was not.  You should give this place a try but skip the fries.,Wonderful Doctors Office and he always on time and caring. I am very glad they take my obscure insurance and that they are close to my home.
