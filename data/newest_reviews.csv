Timestamp,Please write a review below for any business:,Please rate the business on a scale of 1 to 5,"Though I got what I was looking for, this store is very disappointing.  The problem  I had was that many aisles were not labeled properly which made it difficult for me to quickly find the things I needed.  I only came in for four items and it should not have taken 40 minutes to find them and check out.  There were also not readily available team members to ask about where these products were located.  Very disappointing.","Ankur explained my dishwasher problem and helped me weigh some options in a 50/50 repair or replace situation. Other notable factors, he was polite, on time, knowledgeable, clear and honest. I have no complaints.We will use this company again, but we hope we don't need to.",This is literally the worst Tropical Smoothie I've ever been to. Smoothies are watery EVERY time. Staff barely comes to the counter or they just chat with each other while you're waiting. If you order online the smoothies aren't kept refrigerated so they're melted before you even get there. Once I gave the cashier a gift card and then a dollar to cover the difference and the cashier puts in my dollar and hands me back my gift card with .48. Makes no sense at all. Horrible customer service at this place!,This is a new Paisanos location and I decided to give it a try. I've been to Paisanos in Centreville and thought it was good but out of the way for me. I ordered the chicken parm sub platter which included fries. You could tell the employees were still learning and trying to figure out how to serve customers and use the cash registers. The sub was good but the fries were not good at all. The fries were fresh and hot but they were soggy and did not have a good flavor. The sub had lots of cheese and the marinara sauce had a good flavor.  One of the employees was friendly the other was not.  You should give this place a try but skip the fries.,Wonderful Doctors Office and he always on time and caring. I am very glad they take my obscure insurance and that they are close to my home.

2019/06/13 9:44:26 AM AST,"I had a wonderful experience at Indochino; the store was elegant and well-organized and the staff were very helpful and charming. Even though they do not generally fit women for bespoke suiting, they were very accommodating and while I have not yet received the finished pieces, I am hopeful about the result!  ",5,3,3,4,5,3
2019/06/13 6:49:41 PM AST,The food was excellent but I was sort of put off by the takeaway packaging. Fries were just sitting in an open boat and the chicken was only covered with parchment paper. Highly recommend the dumplings.,3,4,4,3,4,2
2019/06/13 8:38:09 PM AST,"Cat Supply Plus had everything I needed and more for my cats. The cashier was extremely polite and helpful. The litter she recommended is the best I've ever used, and the cats LOVE it! I'd recommend Cat Supply Plus to everyone!",5,5,5,4,3,3
2019/06/14 11:12:31 AM AST,"I recommend this clinic. I had to wait weeks before I could check my baby into this weight loss clinic. That was the only negative. The facilities were comfortable (in fact, downright posh compared to my house), and the staff was attentive and compassionate. Best of all, the program worked and my cat has curbed his overeating.",5,1,4,1,3,5
2019/06/14 11:56:03 AM AST,The food was incredible. It seemed a little overpriced for the portion sizes though and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk so I wouldn't go there for a date but it is a cool place and the drinks were great and reasonably priced.,4,3,5,1,4,5
2019/06/14 12:01:43 PM AST,The guy doing the pressure washing on my house cancelled twice. He finally showed up yesterday.  Not happy with his scheduling.  But... he actually did a very nice job on my old deck.  It looks brand new.,4,2,5,1,4,5
2019/06/14 2:02:04 PM AST,"I had a wonderful dinner at this restaurant last. They knew exactly how to cook my salmon (I’m quite picky). Prices are high, but you get what you pay for. I left feeling full and happy. Service was hospitable, but not overdone.  ",5,4,3,3,1,1
2019/06/14 2:19:09 PM AST,"Their burgers are as good as always, but their fries have gone downhill from when they began. They are far too crispy and almost inedible. Hope to have them restored to their former glory. ",3,3,4,1,4,5
2019/06/14 2:47:21 PM AST,"Good for a small group drink, apps, and watching games. However, the employee in the hat was openly rude on multiple occasions. Will probably not have company happy hours here in the future.",2,2,5,1,3,5
2019/06/14 3:22:05 PM AST,"Apple bees is the bomb. I love it so much. Wait is this the place that has  babyback ribs? I love it. The servers wear flair, the drinks are large, and it's always bumpin. Delicious!",5,2,5,1,4,5
2019/06/14 3:22:51 PM AST,Dangerously Delicious Pies is my favorite indulgence food in DC. The pies are great (I like the savory even more than the sweet) plus it has a cool divey vibe. Don't forget 2 for $5 natty boes!!,5,2,5,1,4,4
2019/06/14 3:23:57 PM AST,I really enjoy this dentist. The rootcanals are not painful. They take insurance. They are on time and don't make you wait forever. At+ for being very clean. Also the have free toothpaste. ,4,2,5,1,3,5

2019/06/14 4:12:35 PM AST,"Food was tasty as always, if tepid. Delivery was terrible. I pre-ordered the food two hours in advance. Driver arrived 45 minutes after the delivery window, and when I had called the restaurant they told me he had picked it up 30 minutes after the food was already supposed to be at my house. No explanation or apology beyond a quick “sorry!” Driver was on the phone when he arrived and wouldn’t have greeted or said anything to me if I hadn’t thanked him in the language he was speaking. To be fair to him, the food was still somewhat warm at this point, which suggested it had been prepared late by the restaurant to begin with. This was my first time ordering delivery from the restaurant and I don’t think I’ll be doing it again. ",2,2,4,1,3,4

2019/06/14 5:40:57 PM AST,Super knowledgeable staff. They know the products in detail and are sincerely interested in guiding you to what's best for you. My only complaint is that they are often a bit too eager. Sometimes I just want to browse for myself...,5,1,5,1,3,4

2019/06/14 6:30:14 PM AST,"I went to this restaurant, ordered a hamburger and french fries. The burger was undercooked so I asked them to cook it longer. By the time it came out my fries were cold. I never saw the waitress again until she brought out my bill. Not a good dining experience. . ",2,3,4,3,2,4
2019/06/14 7:02:53 PM AST,"The Georgetown Data Science Certificate program is okay. Some of the courses and were really useful and I learned a great deal from some of the faculty; however, there is also a lot of fluff in some of the courses and thought some of it was a waste of time. Overall it was solid, but I would check to see which faculty will be teaching which courses before you enroll. It's important to realize that the price is pretty low, so the price to quality ratio is pretty good.",4,2,5,1,3,5

2019/06/14 7:12:39 PM AST,"The service was horrible. We were waiting for over 20min even though we had a reservation. Once we were sitting the server took over 20min to bring the menus, and once we order the food took forever and came cold.  I don't know was day the place was under staff or what but I wouldn't recommend it. ",1,1,4,1,3,5

2019/06/14 7:30:31 PM AST,This place was totally amazing. It was the best food I’ve ever had. I would give it all five stars but the service was atrocious. The waiter didn’t take our orders until we waived at him. But the food. Maybe this is why they can get away with having rude service but still have so many amazing customers.,3,3,5,1,4,5
2019/06/14 10:07:04 PM AST,"I wanted to surprise my son by taking him here for his birthday. I had heard decent things about the place, but I was shocked by the service. Unbelievably dirty tables. Disgusting food. Overpriced. Nothing positive about this place. Will not come back.",1,2,5,1,3,5
2019/06/14 10:24:05 PM AST,"I went to Irie Jerk Bar and Grill. I sat at the bar, attended to right away. Staff gave good food recommendations. I ordered a beer and take out food. The owner himself checked in on me. Everyone was very friendly. As far as the food, I wasn’t sure what to expect. It was different in a good way. Fried plantains were delicious. Rice and beans hit the spot. Chicken was very “jerky”.

2019/06/14 10:29:04 PM AST,"The service took a little longer than expected, but my car was in great shape afterwords. The staff were all courteous, but I didn't need to hear all the upselling options available when explaining the problem with my car.",4,2,4,2,3,5
2019/06/14 10:32:31 PM AST,"I went to Target in Lincoln Park. It was really small, not a huge variety. Very cramped, they didn’t have what I was looking for. The staff was friendly but one of my items didn’t have a barcode so I had to wait at checkout.
